# DistilBART
<!---It should be called distilling bart and pegasus, but I don't want to break the link in the paper.-->
This section describes all code and artifacts from our [Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13002)

![DBART](https://huggingface.co/front/thumbnails/distilbart_large.png)

+ For the CNN/DailyMail dataset, (relatively longer, more extractive summaries), we found a simple technique that works, which we call "Shrink and Fine-tune", or SFT.
you just copy alternating layers from `facebook/bart-large-cnn` and fine-tune more on the cnn/dm data. `sshleifer/distill-pegasus-cnn-16-4`, `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` and all other checkpoints under `sshleifer` that start with `distilbart-cnn` were trained this way. 
+ For the XSUM dataset, training on pseudo-labels worked best for Pegasus (`sshleifer/distill-pegasus-16-4`), while training with KD worked best for `distilbart-xsum-12-6`
+ For `sshleifer/dbart-xsum-12-3`
+ We ran 100s experiments, and didn't want to document 100s of commands. If you want a command to replicate a figure from the paper that is not documented below, feel free to ask on the [forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/seq2seq-distillation-methodology-questions/1270) and tag `@sshleifer`. 
+ You can see the performance tradeoffs of model sizes [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EkhDMwVO02m8jCD1cG3RoFPLicpcL1GQHTQjfvDYgIM/edit#gid=0).
and more granular timing results [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EkhDMwVO02m8jCD1cG3RoFPLicpcL1GQHTQjfvDYgIM/edit#gid=1753259047&range=B2:I23).

### Evaluation

use [run_distributed_eval](./run_distributed_eval.py), with the following convenient alias
```bash
deval () {
	proc=$1
	m=$2
	dd=$3
	sd=$4
	shift
	shift
	shift
	shift
	python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=$proc  run_distributed_eval.py \
		--model_name $m  --save_dir $sd --data_dir $dd $@
}
```
On a 1 GPU system, here are four commands (that assume `xsum`, `cnn_dm` are downloaded, cmd-F for those links in this file).

`distilBART`:
```bash
deval 1 sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-12-3 xsum dbart_12_3_xsum_eval --fp16  # --help for more choices.
deval 1 sshleifer/distilbart-cnn_dm-12-6 cnn_dm dbart_12_6_cnn_eval --fp16
```

`distill-pegasus`:
```bash
deval 1 sshleifer/distill-pegasus-cnn-16-4 cnn_dm dpx_cnn_eval
deval 1 sshleifer/distill-pegasus-xsum-16-4 xsum dpx_xsum_eval
```

### Distillation
+ For all of the following commands, you can get roughly equivalent result and faster run times by passing `--num_beams=4`. That's not what we did for the paper.
+ Besides the KD section, you can also run commands with the built-in transformers trainer. See, for example, [builtin_trainer/train_distilbart_cnn.sh](./builtin_trainer/train_distilbart_cnn.sh).
+ Large performance deviations (> 5X slower or more than 0.5 Rouge-2 worse), should be reported.
+ Multi-gpu (controlled with `--gpus` should work, but might require more epochs).

#### Recommended Workflow
+ Get your dataset in the right format. (see 6 files above).
+ Find a teacher model [Pegasus](https://huggingface.co/models?search=pegasus) (slower, better ROUGE) or `facebook/bart-large-xsum`/`facebook/bart-large-cnn` (faster, slightly lower.).
Choose the checkpoint where the corresponding dataset is most similar (or identical to) your dataset.
+ Follow the sections in order below. You can stop after SFT if you are satisfied, or move on to pseudo-labeling if you want more performance.
+ student size: If you want a close to free 50% speedup, cut the decoder in half. If you want a larger speedup, cut it in 4. 
+ If your SFT run starts at a validation ROUGE-2 that is more than 10 pts below the teacher's validation ROUGE-2,  you have a bug. Switching to a more expensive technique will not help. Try setting a breakpoint and looking at generation and truncation defaults/hyper-parameters, and share your experience on the forums!

  
#### Initialization
We use [make_student.py](./make_student.py) to copy alternating layers from the teacher, and save the resulting model to disk
```bash
python make_student.py facebook/bart-large-xsum --save_path dbart_xsum_12_3  -e 12 -d 3
```
or for `pegasus-xsum`
```bash
python make_student.py google/pegasus-xsum --save_path dpx_xsum_16_4  --e 16 --d 4
```
we now have an initialized student saved to  `dbart_xsum_12_3`, which we will use for the following commands.
+ Extension: To replicate more complicated initialize experiments in section 6.1, or try your own. Use the `create_student_by_copying_alternating_layers` function.

#### Pegasus 
+ The following commands are written for BART and will require, at minimum, the following modifications
+ reduce batch size, and increase gradient accumulation steps so that the product `gpus * batch size * gradient_accumulation_steps = 256`. We used `--learning-rate` = 1e-4 * gradient accumulation steps.
+ don't use fp16
+ `--tokenizer_name google/pegasus-large`

### SFT (No Teacher Distillation)
You don't need `distillation.py`, you can just run:

```bash
python finetune.py \
  --data_dir xsum \
  --freeze_encoder --freeze_embeds \
  --learning_rate=3e-4 \
  --do_train \
  --do_predict \
  --fp16 --fp16_opt_level=O1 \
  --val_check_interval 0.1 --n_val 1000 --eval_beams 2 --length_penalty=0.5 \
  --max_target_length=60 --val_max_target_length=60 --test_max_target_length=100 \
  --model_name_or_path dbart_xsum_12_3 \
  --train_batch_size=64 --eval_batch_size=64 \
  --sortish_sampler \
  --num_train_epochs=6 \
  --warmup_steps 500 \
  --output_dir distilbart_xsum_sft_12_3 --gpus 1
```

+ Note: The command that produced `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` is at [train_distilbart_cnn.sh](./[train_distilbart_cnn.sh)

```bash
./train_distilbart_cnn.sh
```
<!--- runtime: 6H on NVIDIA RTX 24GB GPU -->
+ Tip: You can get the same simple distillation logic by using `distillation.py --no_teacher ` followed by identical arguments as the ones in `train_distilbart_cnn.sh`.
If you are using `wandb` and comparing the two distillation methods, using this entry point will make your logs consistent,
because you will have the same hyper-parameters logged in every run.

### Pseudo-Labeling
+ You don't need `distillation.py`.
+ Instructions to generate pseudo-labels and use pre-computed pseudo-labels can be found [here](./precomputed_pseudo_labels.md).
Simply run `finetune.py` with one of those pseudo-label datasets as `--data_dir` (`DATA`, below).

```bash
python finetune.py \
  --teacher facebook/bart-large-xsum --data_dir DATA \
  --freeze_encoder --freeze_embeds \
  --learning_rate=3e-4 \
  --do_train \
  --do_predict \
  --fp16 --fp16_opt_level=O1 \
  --val_check_interval 0.1 --n_val 1000 --eval_beams 2 --length_penalty=0.5 \
  --max_target_length=60 --val_max_target_length=60 --test_max_target_length=100 \
  --model_name_or_path dbart_xsum_12_3 \
  --train_batch_size=32 --eval_batch_size=32 \
  --sortish_sampler \
  --num_train_epochs=5 \
  --warmup_steps 500 \
  --output_dir dbart_xsum_12_3_PL --gpus 1 --logger_name wandb
```

 

To combine datasets, as in Section 6.2, try something like:
```bash
curl -S https://cdn-datasets.huggingface.co/pseudo/xsum/bart_xsum_pl.tgz | tar -xvz -C .
curl -S https://cdn-datasets.huggingface.co/pseudo/xsum/pegasus_xsum.tgz | tar -xvz -C .
curl -S https://cdn-datasets.huggingface.co/summarization/xsum.tar.gz | tar -xvz -C .
mkdir all_pl
cat bart_xsum_pl/train.source pegasus_xsum/train.source xsum/train.source > all_pl/train.source
cat bart_xsum_pl/train.target pegasus_xsum/train.target xsum/train.target > all_pl/train.target
cp xsum/val* all_pl
cp xsum/test* all_pl
```
then use `all_pl` as DATA in the command above.

#### Direct Knowledge Distillation (KD)
+ In this method, we use try to enforce that the student and teacher produce similar encoder_outputs, logits, and hidden_states using `SummarizationDistiller`.
+ This method was used for `sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-12-6`, `6-6`, and `9-6` checkpoints were produced.
+ You must use [`distillation.py`](./distillation.py). Note that this command initializes the student for you.

The command that produced `sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-12-6` is at [./train_distilbart_xsum.sh](train_distilbart_xsum.sh)
```bash
./train_distilbart_xsum.sh --logger_name wandb --gpus 1
```

+ Expected ROUGE-2 between 21.3 and 21.6, run time ~13H.
+ direct KD + Pegasus is VERY slow and works best with `--supervise_forward --normalize_hidden`.

<!--- runtime: 13H on V-100 16GB GPU. -->
